# Overview

This repository contains original data and analysis code for "Name of paper".

The publication (open access) is available Link and you can directly access the PDF file Link.

`Data analysis` contains the different python programs and excel files used for data analysis. Note that these programs use various files from `Experimental_Data`, hence these directory must be present to run most of the python scripts.

`Documents` contains the paper and the supporting information.

`Experimental Data` contains various experimental data, both from pre tests as well as for the reproducibility tests and screening of reaction conditions.

`Experimental Setup` contains all programs used for running the experiments.

`Figures` contains figures that appear in either the manuscript or supporting information

`Labjournal entries` contains the electronic labjournal entries of all relevant experiments, as well as the device entries as .pdf files

Subdirectories contain separate README.md files which detail their contents.

We actively encourage others to work on this interesting new avenue in automatization, are happy to answer questions or comments and are open to cooperations in this field.
